				<h3>
					Chapter 1
				</h3>
				<p>
					So Ethan and I decided to go rock climbing one day. When we finished we went to Five Guys, but I wanted a smoothie, so we went to 
					Joy Yee in Chinatown. This is were it all began. As I was showing Ethan the smoothie menu, we apparently got the attention of a 
					group of girls who also happened to be getting smoothies. After we ordered, one of the girls approached us and offered us the
					Snapchat of one of the other girls. Ethan and I accepted, although Ethan was not visibly excited... Soon after, the rest of the girls
					also added us both on Snapchat. Oddly enough, the one who originally added us was the first to block us.

				<h3>
					Chapter 2
				</h3>
				<p>
					Later that day, I created a group chat with the remaining girls. We discovered that the girls names were Kayla, Kelly, Noel,
					and Kailee. It didn't take long for ethan to add August to the group chat. We continued to talk to the girls for the next few days. 
					Ethan started talking less and less, but August began to connect with Kelly, and I started getting told that Noel and I should date.
					We all wanted Ethan and Kayla to date so that we could go on some weird triple date, but Kayla already had a guy and Ethan was not 
					Having much fun with the situation.

				<h3>
					Chapter 3
				</h3>
				<p>
					So I'm beginning to reach the point in the story where the timeline chatches up to me, so I'm going so start getting into some more
					detail. Anyways, we all started talking much more. The girls showed me and August a strange IOS Skype clone called Houseparty, which
					we began to all talk to each other on. I assume that was just a normal thing for all of them before they met us, but for me and Aug,
					video chatting when not playing video games or something was unheard of, so we learned something new I guess. Well by this point we
					all wanted to meet in person, or at least, I did. These girls were some of the most fun people I knew and I had only met them in 
					person for a few minutes. We began planning a time to meet. Skipping ahead a few hours, I asked them if they wanted me to make a 
					website, and got to work before I heard an answer. It is currently 1:03 AM, and I still havent even put the site on Github, or gotten
					a favicon generated. Anyways, if you are reading this, Im very bored, and this is as far as the story has gotten so far. I might 
					continue to update this site, but TBH probably not.

				<h3>
					Chapter 4
				</h3>
				<p>
					So we all (mostly) met up. August and Kelly are very clearly in love, but they are both too scared to do anything about it. The past
					few days have basically just been me and Kayla trying to covince Aug and Kelly to date. Every night is just long coversations with
					Kelly and Kayla and Noel about August. Anyways, school has now started for all of us and it kinda sucks, but we are still hoping to
					meet up on Saturday. I think that's all I got for this chapter.
